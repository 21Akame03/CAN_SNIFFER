    help
        Select the logging verbosity used by the core CAN Sniffer tasks. You can
        still override individual tags at runtime with `esp_log_level_set()`.

config CAN_SNIFFER_OVERRIDE_GLOBAL_LOG_LEVEL
    bool "Apply selected log level to all log tags"
    default n
    help
        When enabled, the configured log level is applied globally using
        `esp_log_level_set("*", level)`. Disable this if you only want the CAN
        Sniffer components to change their verbosity.

config CAN_SNIFFER_DEBUG_STARTUP_SUMMARY
    bool "Emit startup health summary"
    default y
    help
        Print a detailed health report after initialisation, including the state
        of each subsystem and any error flags that were set.

config CAN_SNIFFER_DEBUG_TASK_EVENTS
    bool "Log task creation results"
    default y
    help
        Emit informational messages whenever CAN Sniffer tasks are created or if
        their creation fails. Helps track RTOS scheduling issues.

config CAN_SNIFFER_DEBUG_TWAI_ALERT_DETAILS
    bool "Log detailed TWAI status on alerts"
    default n
    help
        Collect and print extended TWAI driver status information whenever an
        alert is triggered. Useful when diagnosing bus-level faults.
